## Task 02 – Lottery Number Generator  
**Function:** `get_numbers_ticket(min, max, quantity)`  

To win a lottery, a player must match several numbers on their ticket with randomly drawn numbers within a specific range.

## Task 03 – Phone Number Normalizer  
**Function:** `normalize_phone(phone_number)`  

Your SMS campaign depends on sending messages to valid phone numbers. However, numbers from the database often come in various formats.  
This function **cleans and standardizes phone numbers**, removing unnecessary characters and ensuring they start with a proper international code.  
If no country code is provided, it defaults to `+38` (Ukraine).  
The output is a clean and consistent number format, ready for reliable SMS delivery.
